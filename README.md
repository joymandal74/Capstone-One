Getting the Dataset For Running model on Colab

We are trying to develope a Deep learning based prediction model that can distinguish Anti-Cancer-Peptides(ACP) from peptides that do not contribute significantly to cancer-treatment. This model can narrow down the search space for time and resource consuming canonical  methods, thus facilitate the process of discovering novel ACPs.
