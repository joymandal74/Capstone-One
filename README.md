# Capstone-One

We are trying to develope a Deep learning based prediction model that can distinguish Anti-Cancer-Peptides(ACP) from peptides that do not contribute significantly to cancer-treatment. This model can narrow down the search space for time and resource consuming canonical  methods, thus facilitate the process of discovering novel ACPs. The work is being done as part of capstone project required for obtaining bachelors degree where the end goal is to come up with an architecture that can perform the task better than current state of the art.
